# BudGo.Net - Project-Specific Rules

## PROJECT CONTEXT

**Project:** BudGo.Net - BudGo LLC  
**Location:** /Users/kimo/Documents/Development/BudGo LLC/BudGo.Net  
**Date Created:** January 18, 2026

## ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

Act as a code architecture detective. When analyzing issues:

### 1. SCAN REPOSITORY
- Map major modules, classes, and functions
- Identify dependencies and data flow
- Trace API endpoints and database interactions
- Check state management patterns

### 2. DATA FLOW ANALYSIS
- How data moves between components
- API request/response patterns
- Database interaction logic
- State management updates

### 3. ERROR CORRELATION
- Relate errors to specific files/logic
- Trace error origin through call stack
- Identify failure points in critical path

### 4. ANOMALY DETECTION
- Flag architectural red flags
- Identify inconsistencies in patterns
- Check for deprecated or unused code

### 5. SOLUTION OUTPUT FORMAT

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC STANDARDS

- Follow existing project architecture patterns
- Document all critical path modifications
- Include file paths and line numbers
- Provide working code examples from similar patterns in codebase
- Test changes in isolation before integration

## MCP SERVER HANDLING

When debugging MCP server issues:
- Check server connection configurations
- Validate connection status before operations
- Add retry logic for failed connections
- Log connection state changes
- Handle graceful disconnections


ALWAYS ASK for project-specific context if unsure about architecture or patterns, or if you don't understand the promot.
